## 🚢 Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)


The easiest way to deploy this portfolio is using the Vercel Platform.

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository.
2. Import the project into Vercel.
3. Add your environment variables in the Vercel Dashboard.
4. Deploy!

### Manual Build

npm run build
npm run start

## 🛠 Performance Optimization

This portfolio achieves **100/100 Lighthouse scores** through:
● **Caching** : Static Site Generation (SSG) with Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR).
● **Bundle Optimization** : Tree-shaking and aggressive code splitting via `next/dynamic` for heavy client features (e.g., UI menus, 3D components, and large forms).
● **WebGL & 3D Execution** : Deeply lazy-loaded `@react-three/fiber` and `three.js` ecosystems. Only executed on user interaction or off the critical render path.
● **Asset Strategy** : Next/Image for WebP delivery, LCP prioritized rendering (with fade-in animations removed for critical paint elements), and optimized font loading.
● **Monitoring** : Integration with Vercel Speed Insights and Web Vitals tracking.
